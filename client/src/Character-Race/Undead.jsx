                    Free of the Lich King's grasp, the Forsaken seek to overthrow his rule. Led by Lady Sylvanas, they hunger for vengeance against the Scourge.
                    <br/><br/> 
                    Humans, too have become the enemy, relentless in their drive to purge all Undead from the land.
                    <br/><br/> 
                    The Forsaken care little, even for their allies; to them, the Horde is merely a tool that may further their dark schemes.
